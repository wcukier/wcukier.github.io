    "body": "An absolute beam monitor (ABM) is a device used to measure the properties of a beam line, such as the one used in the Space Physics Laboratory at Princeton.  As a class, we were given the year long project to improve on the previous ABM design with the ultimate goal of 10 ABMs being built to aid the IMAP mission with calibration efforts.  Our new ABM, along with some quality of life and instrument safety improvements, was designed to be wider so that more of the electrons actually hit the electron detectors.  For comparason, our new ABM (ABM-2) achieved a ~15% efficiency for 5keV p+ particles while the ABM-1 only was able to achieve <1% efficiency.  Our presentation describing the project is avalable [here](../files/CDR.pdf).",

Most of my work on this project was spent hacking together a way for the Atmos Climate Model as updated by [Kopparapu et. al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6674) to simulate a two star system instead of a one star system.",

I was searching through targets identified as Eclipsing Binaries on the citizen science project [Planet Hunters TESS](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess) when I noticed an interesting target.  \nBelow is the original lightcurve that I saw-- the dip between day-14 and day-15 is the primary eclipse (i.e. when the smaller star blocks the light of the bigger star) and the smaller dip between days 15 and 16 is the planetary transit.\n![](../files/TOI1338+PH.png)\n*Image Credit [Planet Hunters TESS](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess)*\nThere was a lot of news coverage surrounding this discovery, the following are a couple of my favorites:\n- [Discovery of TESS Missionâ€™s First Circumbinary Planet](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2020/01/07/discovery-of-tess-missions-first-circumbinary-planet/) by Dr. Ravi Kopparapu -- My advisor from the previous summer and secondary advisor that summer\n- [A teenager discovered a new planet on the third day of his NASA internship](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/10/teenager-discovered-new-planet-third-day-his-nasa-internship/) by the Washington Post",
