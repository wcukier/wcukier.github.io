## About Me
I am currently an Undergraduate Student at Princeton University, Class of 2024.  I am concentrating (i.e. majoring) in Astrophysical Sciences.  I am also getting certificates (i.e. minors) in Planets and Life (astrobiology), Applications of Computing, and Applied and Computational Mathematics.  Although I am sure I want to study something in the realm of astrophysics, I am still exploring my options--astrobiology and exoplanets are two major contenders at this moment.

On a more personal level, I have been reading and enjoying a lot of science fiction and fantasy lately -- you can see my recommendations for starting out below and feel free to ask me for more.  I also DM a weekly D&D game with my friends, this winter (2021-2022) I am running *The Ghosts of Saltmarsh*

## Book Recommendations
- The Broken Earth Trilogy by N. K. Jemisin

- Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson (and the rest of the Cosmere)
