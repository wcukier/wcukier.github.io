## My Research

### Geminids Meteoroids
*Paper in prep*

In summer and fall 2021 I worked with [Dr. Jamey Szalay](https://spacephysics.princeton.edu/people/jamey-r-szalay-phd) on simulating the Geminids Meteoroid stream with the primary goal of ruling it out as the source of an anomalous spike in meteroid flux incident upon [Parker Solar Probe.](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/parker-solar-probe)

The simulation and visualization code I wrote is available at [this GitHub repo.](https://github.com/wcukier/Phaethon_Meteoroids/)

### TOI-1338
*Paper: [Kostov et. al. 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07783)*

TOI-1338 b is the planet that I helped to discover in the summer before my senior year of high school while I was working with [Dr. Veselin Kostov](http://www.veselinbkostov.com/) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  I was searching through targets identified as Eclipsing Binaries on the citizen science project [Planet Hunters TESS](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess) when I noticed an interesting target.  

Below is the original lightcurve that I saw-- the dip between day-14 and day-15 is the primary eclipse (i.e. when the smaller star blocks the light of the bigger star) and the smaller dip between days 15 and 16 is the planetary transit.

There was a lot of news coverage surrounding this discovery, the following are a couple of my favorites:
 - [Discovery of TESS Missionâ€™s First Circumbinary Planet](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2020/01/07/discovery-of-tess-missions-first-circumbinary-planet/) by Dr. Ravi Kopparapu -- My advisor from the previous summer and secondary advisor that summer

### Circumbinary Habitable Zones
*Paper: [Cukier et. al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02983)*

This was the research that I did the summer before my junior year of high school with [Dr. Ravi Kopparapu.](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~ruk15/)  The goal of this research was to characterize the liquid water habitable zone for circumbinary planets, planets that orbit two stars.  Most of my work on this project was spent hacking together a way for the Kasting Model as updated by [Kopparapu et. al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6674) to simulate a two star system instead of a one star system.
