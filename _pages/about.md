I am still building out this website -- there may be some default theme links scattered around

## About Me
I am currently an Undergraduate Student at Princeton University, Class of 2024.  I am concentrating (i.e. majoring) in Astrophysical Sciences.  I am also getting certificates (i.e. minors) in Planets and Life (Astrobiology), Applications of Computing, and Applied and Computational Mathematics.  Although I am sure I want to study something in the realm of astrophysics, I am still exploring my options--astrobiology and exoplanets are two major contenders at this moment.


## Book Recommendations
- The Broken Earth Trilogy by N. K. Jemisin

- Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson (and the rest of the Cosmere)

- The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb

- The Expanse by James S. A. Corey
