Hi!  I'm Wolf Cukier, a first year Graduate Student working with Diana Powell at UChicago pursuing a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics.  I am generally interested in exoplanets, mostly from a theoretical or computational perspective.  My current work involves modeling clouds and radiation in brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets using the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA).

Please download my poster [here](https://github.com/wcukier/talks/blob/main/2025/aspen_april2025.pdf).
