Hi!  I'm Wolf Cukier, a first year Graduate Student at UChicago pursuing a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics where I am advised by Diana Powell.  I am generally interested in exoplanets, mostly from a theoretical or computational perspective.  My current work involves modeling clouds and radiation in brown dwarfs and directly imaged giant planets using the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA).

Please download my poster [here](https://github.com/wcukier/talks/blob/main/2025/aspen_april2025.pdf).

If you have any questions please email me at [wcukier@uchicago.edu](mailto:wcukier@uchicago.edu)
