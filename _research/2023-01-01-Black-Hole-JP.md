I worked with Dr. Benjamin Crinquand and Dr. Anatoly Spitkovsky to extract observables relating to the polarized light from Particle-In-Cell simulations of Kerr Black Holes.  This work was conducted as part of my Fall Junior Paper.  A github repository containing part of the code I worked on is available [here](https://github.com/wcukier/polarized_raytracing_public).
