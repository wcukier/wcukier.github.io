I worked with Dr. Jamey Szalay to model the formation and evolution of the Geminids stream and compare our results with Parker Solar Probe data and Earth observations. A short video summarizing the research is here:

  The two main conclusions from the study were that 1) The origin of the Geminids shower was likely a catastrophic event and 2) The Geminids stream is unlikely to be detectable by a spacecraft using a dust detector.  
This research was also presented as an iPoster at AAS 241. A github repository containing the code I worked on for this project is available [here](https://github.com/wcukier/Phaethon_Meteoroids).
