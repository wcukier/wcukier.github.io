I worked with Dr. Chris Chyba to estimate, given the hypothetical of microbial life existing on Venus before Earth, the likelihood that such life would have been transferred viably to Earth on meteor ejecta.  This work was conducted as part of my Spring Junior Paper.  A github repository containing part of the code I worked on is available [here](https://github.com/wcukier/Venus_JP).
