TOI-1338 b is the planet that I helped to discover in the summer before my senior year of high school while I was working with [Dr. Veselin Kostov](http://www.veselinbkostov.com/) at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.  I was searching through targets identified as Eclipsing Binaries on the citizen science project [Planet Hunters TESS](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess) when I noticed an interesting target.  
Below is the original lightcurve that I saw-- the dip between day-14 and day-15 is the primary eclipse (i.e. when the smaller star blocks the light of the bigger star) and the smaller dip between days 15 and 16 is the planetary transit.

There was a lot of news coverage surrounding this discovery, the following are a couple of my favorites:
- [Discovery of TESS Missionâ€™s First Circumbinary Planet](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2020/01/07/discovery-of-tess-missions-first-circumbinary-planet/) by Dr. Ravi Kopparapu -- My advisor from the previous summer and secondary advisor that summer
- [A teenager discovered a new planet on the third day of his NASA internship](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/01/10/teenager-discovered-new-planet-third-day-his-nasa-internship/) by the Washington Post
