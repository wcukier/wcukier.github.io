This was the research that I did the summer before my junior year of high school with [Dr. Ravi Kopparapu.](https://personal.ems.psu.edu/~ruk15/)  The goal of this research was to characterize the liquid water habitable zone for circumbinary planets, planets that orbit two stars.  Most of my work on this project was spent hacking together a way for the Atmos Climate Model as updated by [Kopparapu et. al. 2013](https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6674) to simulate a two star system instead of a one star system.
