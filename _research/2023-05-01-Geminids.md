I worked with Dr. Jamey Szalay to model the formation and evolution of the Geminids stream and compare our results with Parker Solar Probe data and Earth observations. Presented as an iPoster at AAS 241. A github repository containing the code I worked on for this project is available [here](https://github.com/wcukier/Phaethon_Meteoroids).
